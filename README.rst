dataspass
=========

Some time ago, my only connection to the outside world was only via some 3G
modem.

I found myself trapped in a dataplan, with it's hilarious traffic limitations and pricing, always keeping an eye onto traffic consumption.

So, why not automate the lookup?

* No need to switch to the Browser while working in the shell.
* Can be used inside other tools (`geektool <http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/>`_).

.. note::

    If this script is launched from the outside of the mobile network by Telekom, no output is produced.

The goal was to find some solution which has no external dependencies.

Have a lot of fun with it!
